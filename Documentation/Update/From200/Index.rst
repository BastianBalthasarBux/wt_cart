From < 2.0.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Everything has changed. 90% of the code is gone and was replaced by
new functions and a class system. We have changed the templates
quite a bit to support product variants. There is also a huge change
within the tax classes (setup). We recommend checking your TypoScript
settings and your HTML templates on a test system before installing
this update on a productive server.
